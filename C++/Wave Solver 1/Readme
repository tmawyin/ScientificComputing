README FILE -----

Included in tar.gz file:
- HW2_gitLog.log: git log file
- Makefile: make file used for compilation
- outputFile.txt: results file
- waveDriver.cpp: main driver c++ file
- waveRead.cpp: definitions for read/write function 
- waveRead.h: function prototypes for waveRead.cpp
- waveStep.cpp: definitions for initializing and marching in time
- waveStep.h: function prototypes for waveStep.cpp
- waveparems.txt: given file for testing purposes

***** COMPILATION

In a terminal window type:
	make clean
	make

Note: "make clean" will remove the output file containing the results. It will be created once the program runs again

***** RUNNING

In a terminal window type:
	./waveSolver waveparams.txt

OR (if no file is used)

	./waveSolver
